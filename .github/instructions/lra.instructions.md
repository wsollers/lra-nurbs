# LRA Repository Instructions

This file is intended for `.github/instructions/lra.instructions.md`. Keep it
concise and refer to canonical governance docs rather than copying large docs.

## Global Agent Rules

- Treat generated instruction files as derived artifacts.
- Follow the owning repository boundary for every task.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, tokens, or machine-local private values.
- Do not modify mathematical content during governance or wrapper-generation tasks.
- Do not touch `Learning-Real-Analysis/scripts/`.
- Port emergency downstream instruction repairs back to `lra-governance`.

## Repo Overlay

# lra-nurbs Overlay

Stub overlay for C++ / Vulkan / geometry / simulation work.

Owned concerns:

- C++ and CMake build rules,
- Vulkan rendering rules,
- geometry and NURBS implementation,
- simulation and DDE implementation,
- local validators and CI expectations.

## Agent Scope

C++ / Vulkan / geometry / simulation rules apply only to `lra-nurbs` and the
monorepo `nurbs_dde/` mirror. They must not be injected into volume content
instructions.

Use local CMake, tests, and repo validators for implementation changes.

## Provider Notes

Keep provider-specific guidance concise and defer durable policy to governance docs.
